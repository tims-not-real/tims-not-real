            I was born in Perth, Western Australia. I lived here until mid-way through highschool when I dropped out and fled home to live in Melbourne, Victoria.
            <br><br>
            While finishing my highschool cert, I found an interest in mathematical beauty. I was captivated by how mathematical thinking could offer piercing ways to 
            understand the complexities of the world.
            <br><br>
            I self-studied mathematics, using Khan Academy, and enrolled at whatever university would accept a student with no pre-requisites, and a low graduating score, 
            into a physics program. That happened to be the Swinburne University of Technology. 
            <br><br>
            During university I thrived. It was a place where I could chase my interests with little restriction. During uni I worked across optical fibre physics, 
            hydroacoustics, and social analytics, before realising theoretical studies is where my interests reside. Alongside this, I started to become more critical of the 
            real world outside of physics and mathematics, and I realised there are problems with society that are far too frustrating and unfair to ignore. Complex systems was 
            a natural path forward, where I could satisfy this frustration, contribute my abilities in physics and maths, and of course, retain proximity to the mathematical beauty 
            that still captivates me.      
            <br><br>
            Outside of academics, I like techno, plants, and myopically approaching anything that sounds like an adventure.

        <p>
            I'm a Vienna-based complex systems scientist. My background is in mathematical physics and I work on complex systems theory at
            <a href="https://www.csh.ac.at/">CSH, Vienna</a> as a Ph.D. candidate.  
            
            <br><br>
            My research aims to unravel the deep roots of societal problems through the complex systems lens. I'm motivated by the simple idea that
            <em>we must be able to do better</em>. We have many concurrent global problems that are limited not by our understanding of them, but extraneous
            barriers like misinformation, corruption, and perverse interests. <em>Perhaps understanding how to overcome these barriers is a science in and of itself?</em>   

            <br><br>    
            Before CSH I was a visiting scholar at <a href="https://www.gsais.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en-top/overview">GSAIS, Kyoto University</a> 
            (a.k.a. 思修館) studying the entropy of complex systems under the supervision of <a href="https://kdb.iimc.kyoto-u.ac.jp/profile/ja.8490c78a7879636b.html">
            Prof. Liang Zhao</a>. Prior to that I completed my honours degree at <a href="https://www.swinburne.edu.au/about/our-structure/organisational-structure/schools-departments/school-science-computing-engineering-technologies/department-mathematics">
            Swinburne University, Melbourne</a> studying self-avoiding walk models under the supervision of <a href="https://clisby.net/">Prof. Nathan Clisby</a>. 
            <br><br>
            Feel welcomed to reach out to me to talk about any ideas, requests, or questions you might have.
            I'm always happy to make good ideas happen.
